## Overview

These short programs were created as introductory coursework for the
**Python Programming** module at **Sahand University of Technology**.
The goal is to practice fundamental concepts&mdash;input handling, loops,
conditionals and basic algorithms&mdash;while cultivating clear coding style.
Although the examples are simple, they form a foundation for tackling more
advanced numerical problems and entry-level AI algorithms in the future.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/RasoulUnlimited/Small-projects-with-python).
2. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
3. Run any exercise using `python PartX.py` (replace `X` with `1-8`).
